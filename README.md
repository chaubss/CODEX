# CODEX
Compiler Construction Group Assignment

## Running
Create an executable by running:
```
make
```
This will create an executable `lexer`, run it:
```
./lexer <input file>
```
### Running the testcases
Several testcases have been provided in the `testcases/input` directory. You can run them all at once by running the `run_testcases.sh` script.
1. Add your testcases to the `testcases/input` directory.
2. Give permission to run the shell script:
```
chmod +x run_testcases.sh
```
3. Run all testcases:
```
./run_testcases.sh
```

The output for these testcases will be stored in the `testcases/output` directory.
